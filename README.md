### Hey there ðŸ‘‹
### My Gorgeous friends on GitHub. ( Yes it's inspired from DevEd in case you know him ðŸ˜… )

Myself Rajat. I am the founder of RightWays. We help people to live their passion by providing them the right opportunities
It's nice to see you here. ðŸ™‚

### I am a self-taught designer and developer and have done my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science Engineering.
I have worked with different startups and non-profit organizations in the past. What I love about me is that I never say NO to any work that is important to me and is out of my skill set. I have experienced many such tasks during my ("still a small") startup journey. Yeah, that's pretty much about me.

### Currently I am also working as a Full Time Employee at XR based startup. We are building some fun stuff for the Meta Verse :)

I want to help all those individuals who are confused about their career paths and as a result, they are out on a wrong way. Through RightWays, I wish to bring them back to the RightWay of their career.
